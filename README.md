# Mercado Livre Product Searcher with React #

### Story Phrase ###
* The challenge is to create a React app with Express and Route of a product searcher using Mercado Livre's API

### Configuration ###
* Install Node.JS on your computer
* Enter in folder "client", Run `npm i` to install all dependences needed to execute client part of this project
* Enter in folder "server", Run `npm i` to install all dependences needed to execute this project.

### Compile / Run ###
* Run `npm start` inside the folder client so that webpack can compile the project and serve it on **http://localhost:3000/**
* Run `npm start` inside the folder server so that webpack can compile the project and serve it on **http://localhost:3001/**

### Tests ###
* Inside the "client" folder, Run `npm run test`. It would run the tests and show the results on console.

### Technical Details ###
* To develop this challenge, I used the framework [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) alongside with [WebPack](https://webpack.github.io/), throught [Create React App] (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
* For style sheets' creation, I used Sass and complemented the styles with [Twitter Bootstrap](https://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and some icons from [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
* For the server side, I used [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* For the tests, I used Jest that comes with Create React App

### Considerations ###
> I just started to study React.JS, so, probably there is some practices that are not so good on the project, but I've tried my best to minimize them. So, thanks for this challenge! I've learned a lot! I had to figure out so many things on my own, that I'm very proud of what I've accomplished.
